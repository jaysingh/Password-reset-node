Password-reset-node
===================

A simple script which runs on top of Passport to reset the password for a user.

This script helps you to reset password for the user if you have used passport-local (passport) for authentication. It takes
the new password as input from request and saves the new password for the user.

Any comment/pull-requests are welcomed.

Thank you.
